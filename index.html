        <h1> About Popflix and my recommendations</h1>	
		  <p> Welcome to my website, I started this website because i want to help make watching movies
		      more exciting and thrilling at home, So i have carefully selected movies which i can
			  guarantee you will rate at least  one of these movies 5 stars.
			  These movies i'm recommending i can take a wild guess that you've never watched 
			  any of them , because i know how boring it can get watching the same movies over and over 
			  again. </p>
		  	  
		  <p> The good part about my recommendations is that not only have i recommended movies in different genres 
              because i know how overwhelming it can be to choose movies people will like,I have also recommended websites  
			   where you will watch movies for free isn't that cool :)</p>	
			   
		  <p> I would appreciate it if you watch some of my recommended movies and also feel free to 
		      and let me know which are your favourite movies and also don't forget to share our page with others </p>
