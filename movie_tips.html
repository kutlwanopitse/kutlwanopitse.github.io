	     <h1>Enhancing your movie experience at home</h1>
             <h3> 1. Choose the best movies</h3>
		         <p> When you’re watching a movie at home, time is precious – which means you can’t afford to  
				     accidentally get stuck watching a terrible movie. The solution is simple: only choose the best movies.
					 Fortunately, this isn’t as difficult as it sounds. For example, you can play it safe by watching some
					 of the movies i recommended. </p>
					 
		     <h3> 2. Use the websites i provided </h3>
			     <p> Next up is a handy little trick that will be much appreciated by people looking to save money. Yep – you
				     guessed it – the trick is to use those website i chose to watch movies for free. </p>
					
					 
			 <h3> 3. Create your own setup </h3>
			     <p> Watching movies at home is automatically made more fun when you have a setup. </p>
				  
				 
				 
				 
				 
		     <h3> 4. Invite friends to join you	</h3>
			      <p> Let’s be honest, watching movies alone can get a little boring after a while. That’s why it's a good idea
				      to nvite your friends over to join you for the occasional movie night. You can all
					  snuggle up together and get lost in the story . </p>

		     <h3> 5. Change the audio and brightness settings to enhance your experience </h3>
                  <p> TVs and the streaming services themselves usually come with audio and brightness settings that you can alter
				      alter to your personal preference. For example, if you’re someone who likes to see every minor detail on the 
					  screen, then you should maximize the brightness. On the other hand, you might be someone who prefers a softly
					  lit screen and lower volume levels, to not experience sensory overload. Whatever your preferences are, make sure 
					  to dive into the settings and alter them.</p>
					  
		     <h3> 6. Stock up on your favorite drinks and snacks </h3>
                  <p> Watching movies at home isn’t the same without drinks and snacks. In fact, it’s a crime !
				      The next time you know you’re going to watch a movie at home, remind yourself to stock up
					  on your favorite drinks and snacks. This way, if the movie sucks, at least you’ll have another
					  source of entertainment. </p>
			 <h3> 7. Make sure you have a strong internet connection </h3>
                  <p> If you’re streaming movies, a strong internet connection is key. Without it, your experience is going		
                      to be ruined by constant lagging and frame skips.</p>
